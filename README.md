# Quiz-1
This is a timed quiz website that will time the user on their Javascript knowledge.

## Description
Upon landing on this page you will have the option to start the quiz. Once entering the quiz you will see a score tracker that will show the user what question they are on and how many are left. Bellow that will be the users score, in multiples of "100". Right under that will be the section for the current question the user is on. The quiz is timed and will have the 1 minute timer above the question section. The quiz is a 4 option multiple choice. Once the user finishes the quiz, they will be prompted to enter their name to save the score in local storage.

## Challenges and Improvments
I had several issues with saving the users name in local storage. I was only able to get the most recent score to save in local. Another challenge that I had was only being able to save one score. The last challenge that I had was reducing time when a wrong answer was selected. These are all improvments that will make the application better.
